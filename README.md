# Marine-Ray-Finned-Fishes-Extinction-Risk
Code and data for paper titled "A Global Ecological Signal Of Extinction Risk in Marine Ray-Finned Fishes"

R Code is numbered by order to work through - go through sequentially to generate all data, figures, etc. for this project.
All code is annnotated and explains why each step is taken and when data is being pulled in from outside source.

WoRMs database was downloaded from https://www.marinespecies.org/

Fishbase is created by using the PHP code included.

IUCN data downloads are generated within the R code, a token is needed to access the API the code utilizes to download the data - request a token here: https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token

Confidence Interval Widths were calculated in Excel instead of R - this is captured in the Excel file "Best_Model_Results_Compare_CIW"
